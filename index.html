  I was born in Seoul, South Korea. <br>

<p>
  by opportunity, I found there is a coding school called Ecole 42
  that anyone can apply regardless of their academic background
  and they offer the lectures with no tuition
  (which is the coolest factor;))<br>

<p>
  you could wonder how about piano? <br>
  I have playing the piano almost since 30years ago. <br>
  you can see how i love the piano. <br>
  to play the piano is my destiny and that was my first professional job. <br>
  now I’m more focus as a developer so I can’t play that much. <br>
  but I still love to organise small concert. <br>
  when I have time and my dream is to live a house can offer many concerts.<br>

  <p>
  let me talk about more of other things.<br>
  i am passionated to travel. <br>
  my to do list of life is visit all country of the earth.<br>
  i need to travel at least 2 times by a year.<br>
  but what I really want is not just be a tourist. <br>
  it means when I visit some cities I want to live at least 2 weeks. <br>
  a major advantage of being a programmer is I could work even during visiting other cities.<br>
  what i need is only my laptop and wifi.<br>

  I’ll introduce you soon about that. <br>
  in order to complete my mission I should learn many things
  so I’m still learning and I love to learning.<br>
